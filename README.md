# Basic-MIPS-Assembly

Computer Organization course assignment and MIPS.

ex1.asm

Program that computes the area of a rectangle given the width and the height and also calculates and prints perimeter.

ex2.asm

Modify the ex1.asm program in ex2.asm to make it work on multiple inputs. In particular, it should repeatedly ask for width and height values, and print the corresponding area and perimeter, until the user enters the value 0 for width. At that point, the program should terminate.
